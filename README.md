# ECMA project
Authors : Hannes van Overloop and Louise Eymery

This project considers four different methods to solve a robust partitionning problem.
The document Rapport.pdf analyzes our results.
The file benchmark.jl contains the functions used to test our different methods. 
The four methods are coded in branchAndCut.jl, dualisation.jl, heuristic.jl and plansCoupants.jl.
